    The negative consequences of this concentration of ownership are that it can
    enabled a handful of corporate news outlets to normalize baseless or false

    today’s billionaires recognize that by controlling the free flow of information they
    can control or shape the electorate’s democratic participation. For example, soon after
    casino mogul Sheldon Adelson purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports surfaced that
    stories about the billionaire were being censored or altered so he could manage the public’s
    image of his businesses in the gambling-centric city.</p>
